This project on Document Layout Analysis seeks to explore the self-supervised learning that is used for various document tasks such as form and receipt understanding, question and answering, and document layout analysis. We implement for the task of document layout analysis, the pretrained models LayoutLMv3 and Mask R-CNN (of Publaynet) on the validation dataset of Publaynet and on also on a medical thesaurus.
